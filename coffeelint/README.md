# VS Code ESLint extension
Integrates [CoffeeLint](https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint) into VS Code.

This extension reads the `coffeelint.json` file in the root of the workspace (project). If your project doesn't have this file yet, then just run:

```sh
$ npx coffeelint --makeconfig > coffeelint.json
```

## Configuration Options
- `coffeelint.enable`: enable/diable coffeelint. Is enabled by default.

## Contributing
See [GitHub](https://github.com/hellodigit/vscode-coffeelint).
